# unixbash-scripts
A collection of UNIX bash scripts I often use. 

**WARNING**
All scripts available here have been copy-pasted from my existing works. 
I cannot guarantee that they are free of errors - though I have done my best to avoid this.
Please make it a point to test run them somewhere safe before using them in a production grade environment.
